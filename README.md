## About The Project

### Nodejs Starter Server
This Node.js starter server is designed to be a powerful and flexible foundation for your projects, providing essential functions and robust security to kick-start your development process.<br>

Flexibility is a core feature of this starter server. It allows you to seamlessly add extra fields to any model without modifying the original schema. These additional fields are stored in a separate model, ensuring that the primary structure remains untouched and maintainable. This approach not only preserves the integrity of your original models but also makes it easy to retrieve and utilize these extra fields whenever needed.<br>
This Node.js starter server is an ideal tool for quickly and securely launching your next project, offering a solid, secure, and flexible foundation.
